This script will generate XMI files from your python source, suitable for
importing into UML Modelling tools.  I've only tried it with MagicDraw, which
is my tool of choice.

This is hugely kludgy and barely past proof-of-concept stage, however I've used
it successfully for many years.  YMMV.

To use the files in magicdraw, you should use the File->Import menu option.
