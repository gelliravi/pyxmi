NOTE: This is experimental software.  I've got no idea how well it'll work
for you :)

Usage: SourceParser.py [-v] [-z] [-Z] [-t tool] [-o output] input...
       -v        verbose
       -z        zip output (UNSUPPORTED)
       -Z        Zope support
       -t tool   Specify which tool to write for (default MagicDraw)
       -o output write to filename output

If no output is specified, it writes to stdout.
Zope support provides interpretation of skins and www directories.

To use the files in magicdraw, you should use the File->Import menu option.

If you are using Zope support, the files generated have both robustness and UML
Web Extension stereotypes.  You will need to load the UML Web Extension module
before importing.  The easiest way to do this is to create a blank web diagram.
